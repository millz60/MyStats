MyStats Personal Stat Tracking App

###About
This app was designed to allow the user to track his or her personal statistics for any category they can think of. Track things
like the food you've tried, drinks you've experimented with, golf courses played, and anything else that comes to mind.

###Usage
To add a category, press the "+" button in the top corner. Enter the name of the category and press "Save" to add it to the list. 
Once saved, you can select the category and be taken to a table with more specific statistics that you can add for each category. 
Swipe to delete a category if you no longer want to track your personal stats in that area. Once you have added a stat, you can
increment that stat by selecting it and using the stepper on the page that selecting the stat brings up. Enjoy!
